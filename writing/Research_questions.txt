a)      What was the source, timing, extent (amplitude) of this event (from an oceanographic perspective) – how fast did it move, what preceded and followed it (upwelling?). You said you measured a 12 degree drop – that’s amazing!
b)     Where did it make landfall and where did it move offshore (seems that impacts were noticed in the Transkei and East coast, Knysna and down here – so far).
c)      What were the impacts – measured in terms of fish mortality and unusual fish catches and other impacts (we heard about some sea grass bleaching).
